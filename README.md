This information can help improve the quality of services or materials provided.

## Components

The app is composed of four input components, each corresponding to a different aspect of the user experience:

1. **Feeling**: Users can rate their overall feeling on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 indicates a poor feeling and 5 indicates an excellent feeling.

2. **Understanding**: Users can indicate how well they understood the material using a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 representing poor understanding and 5 representing excellent understanding.

3. **Support**: Users can rate how supported they felt throughout the experience, using a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 indicates poor support and 5 indicates excellent support.

4. **Comments**: Users have the opportunity to leave any additional comments they would like to share regarding their experience. This can provide valuable qualitative feedback.
